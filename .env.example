# Note: 
# 1. You need to create storage buckets in your Supabase project:
#    - 'products' bucket for product images
#    - 'grains' bucket for grain images
# 2. Make sure to set proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies for these buckets
# 3. Enable public access for the buckets if you want images to be publicly viewable
